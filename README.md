## Seminar Title

**The ‘Public’, Disrupted: The Transformative Effects of Technology on Decision-Making**

**Presenter:** Dr Neli Frost
**Host:** Dr Federica Fedorczyk

## Background and Context

This seminar explored how digital and AI-driven systems are reshaping political, legal, and institutional processes traditionally carried out by humans. The discussion focused on the increasing reliance on algorithmic tools by judges, civil servants, and public institutions, as well as the growing role of digital platforms in shaping collective decision-making and public discourse.

From a Computer Science standpoint, the seminar provided a critical lens on how technical systems, when deployed at scale, do not merely automate tasks but actively reconfigure social structures, authority, accountability, and legitimacy.

## Core Themes and Insights

### 1. AI as an Institutional Actor

A key insight was that AI systems are no longer neutral tools operating in the background. Instead, they increasingly function as **institutional actors** that:

* Influence legal outcomes
* Shape policy execution
* Mediate interactions between individuals and governing bodies

This raises ethical concerns about **delegation of authority**, especially when human judgment is partially or fully replaced by automated decision-making systems.

---

### 2. Ethics for AI: Normative Design Challenges

The seminar highlighted deep ethical tensions arising from AI integration into governance-related domains, including:

* **Opacity and explainability**: Many algorithmic systems used in legal or administrative contexts lack transparency, making it difficult for affected individuals to understand or challenge outcomes.
* **Responsibility gaps**: When decisions are influenced by machine outputs, accountability becomes fragmented across developers, deployers, and institutions.
* **Value misalignment**: AI systems may encode efficiency-driven objectives that conflict with fairness, proportionality, or contextual judgment.

These issues underscore the need for **ethics-by-design**, where moral and legal values are embedded at the system architecture level rather than addressed retrospectively.

### 3. AI for Security: Systemic Risks and Safeguards

From an AI-for-security perspective, the seminar raised concerns about the structural vulnerabilities introduced by large-scale algorithmic governance:

* **Centralization of decision power** in technical systems increases the impact of failures, biases, or adversarial manipulation.
* **Automation bias** can lead human operators to over-trust machine recommendations, reducing meaningful oversight.
* **Data dependency risks** emerge when security-relevant decisions rely on incomplete, biased, or manipulable datasets.

These challenges suggest that AI security must go beyond technical robustness and include **institutional resilience**, human-in-the-loop safeguards, and procedural checks.

### 4. Reconfiguring the Concept of the ‘Public’

A central theoretical contribution of the seminar was the examination of how the concept of the “public” is transformed when human participation is mediated—or displaced—by machines.

Key points included:

* Digital platforms fragment collective engagement into data points, profiles, and predictive models.
* Algorithmic mediation reshapes who is seen, heard, or prioritized in institutional processes.
* The shift from human judgment to machine processing alters how legitimacy and inclusion are constructed.

For computer scientists, this highlights that system design choices directly affect social representation and collective agency.

## Implications for Computer Science Research

This seminar reinforces several critical research priorities:

1. **Interdisciplinary AI development** combining technical expertise with legal and ethical theory.
2. **Auditable and explainable systems** for high-stakes institutional use.
3. **Security-aware governance AI**, accounting for misuse, systemic bias, and cascading failures.
4. **Human-centered automation**, ensuring that AI augments rather than replaces responsible human judgment.

## Personal Academic Takeaway

As a Computer Science researcher, this seminar emphasized that building AI systems for governance, law, or security contexts is not merely a technical challenge. It is a socio-technical responsibility that requires anticipating how algorithms reshape institutions, authority structures, and collective participation.

The session provided a strong conceptual foundation for aligning **Ethics for AI** with **AI for Security**, especially in environments where algorithmic decisions have lasting societal impact.
